how safe is my data sent through openai api and what guarantees can I give to my clients if I use it?


I want you to give me a detailed overview of all the steps to take to implement all the thing we discussed, the pipeline and librairies/utilities or anything important to know, understand or keep in mind
note that I want to anonimized all sensitive data that follows before sending anything to open ai api in my pipeline and be able to reconstitute it after receiving the results. Here's teh sensitive data:
### **Most Critical or Frequent Sensitive Data in Company Emails**

1. **Personal Information (PII)** – Names, emails, phone numbers, job titles.
2. **Financial Data** – Bank details, invoices, salaries, profit/loss reports.
3. **Credentials & Access** – Usernames, passwords, API keys, system URLs.
4. **Client & Vendor Information** – Contracts, business deals, contact details.
5. **Confidential Business Data** – Internal strategies, mergers, product plans.
6. **Legal & Compliance** – Lawsuits, internal investigations, regulatory reports.
7. **Security & IT** – Incident reports, cybersecurity policies, infrastructure details.


===============================================================

- is there a way to "vectorize" my mail that's cheaper than a query to openai and quick like getting a hash but an operation where the value of two similar mails (with slight variations) would be close and two very different mails be far? if so I'd like to use that, even if it's like a sentencetransformer or whatever idk

- I don't need to anonymize the data for the ML part, I even think that I'll get better results if the data is not anonimized, how can we adapt the pipeline accordingly?
===============================================================


1. Collect mails
2. Pre-Processing
	1. store structured way: sender, subject, body, to, cc, timestamp, attachments
	2. anonimize data (with posibility of deanonimizing it later): add extra attributes with anonimized data (a_sender, a_subject, a_body, a_to, a_cc)
		1. note that I want to anonimized all sensitive data that follows before sending anything to open ai api in my pipeline and be able to reconstitute it after receiving the results. Here's teh sensitive data: ### **Most Critical or Frequent Sensitive Data in Company Emails** 1. **Personal Information (PII)** – Names, emails, phone numbers, job titles. 2. **Financial Data** – Bank details, invoices, salaries, profit/loss reports. 3. **Credentials & Access** – Usernames, passwords, API keys, system URLs. 4. **Client & Vendor Information** – Contracts, business deals, contact details. 5. **Confidential Business Data** – Internal strategies, mergers, product plans. 6. **Legal & Compliance** – Lawsuits, internal investigations, regulatory reports. 7. **Security & IT** – Incident reports, cybersecurity policies, infrastructure details.
	3. once all the mails are collected and the above preprocessing steps are done, do a query to openai using the anonimized attributes to generate a summary and cleaned up version of each mails and also assign them a priority score (independantyl from the other mails of the batch), and deanonimize the summary and add it as an attribute of the mail (QUESTION maybe that step isn't so necessary, we should measure how much it impacts the feature engineering part) (NOTE, to save money we should use the sentence transformer vectorization in order to measure if we already asked gpt to summarize and prioritize a mail and cache the results)
		1. for cost effectiveness do openai queries that works by batches of mails (find batch sizes that are the most cost efficient without loosing accuracy)
		2. here's the prioritizing part of the prompt example:
			1. `You are an expert email assistant trained to classify emails based on priority. Analyze the following email and assign it a priority score from 1 to 5: 1 - Very Low Priority (newsletters, social media updates, etc.) 2 - Low Priority (internal updates, non-urgent meeting invites, etc.) 3 - Medium Priority (follow-ups, general inquiries, work-related discussions) 4 - High Priority (urgent tasks, approvals, immediate responses required) 5 - Critical Priority (legal issues, security threats, urgent executive emails) **Email Details:** - **Sender:** {sender} - **Recipients (To):** {to} - **CC Recipients:** {cc} - **Subject:** {subject} - **Body:** {body} - **Attachments:** {attachments} - **Timestamp:** {timestamp} Based on this, return a JSON object with a single key `"priority_score"` and its value between 1 and 5. `
3. Feature Engineering
	1. compute ML classic features using the normal attributes
		1. use the following criterias for the classic ML features:
			1. ### **1. Sender-Related Criteria (Easy to Quantify)** - **VIP Senders:** Emails from executives, managers, or key contacts. - **Email Address Domain:** Internal emails vs. external emails. --- ### **2. Subject Line Analysis (Quick and Measurable)** - **Urgent Keywords:** "Urgent," "ASAP," "Immediate Action Required," etc. - **Meeting or Task-Related Phrases:** "Follow-up," "Action Required," "Reminder." --- ### **3. Content-Based Analysis (LLMs Can Parse and Score)** - **Action-Oriented Phrases:** "Please review," "Needs approval," "Waiting for your response." - **Deadlines & Dates Mentioned:** "Due tomorrow," "By EOD," "Next Monday." - **Monetary Terms:** "Invoice," "Payment," "Purchase Order." - **Sentiment Analysis:** Detect urgency and strong emotions. --- ### **4. Thread & Conversation Analysis (Structured & Quantifiable)** - **Repeated Follow-ups:** More than one email on the same topic from the same sender. - **Email Thread Depth:** If an email is part of a long, ongoing discussion. - **Direct vs. CC/BCC:** Direct recipients are more likely to need action. --- ### **5. Attachments & Links (Binary Detection)** - **Presence of Attachments:** PDFs, DOCXs, Excel sheets, especially from key contacts. - **Size of Attachments:** Large files often indicate detailed reports or critical documents. --- ### **6. Contextual Factors (Easy to Extract and Use)** - **Time of Receipt:** During working hours vs. weekends/after-hours. --- ### **7. Spam & Low-Priority Filters (Removes Noise)** - **Marketing & Newsletters:** Promotional, marketing, and automated system emails. - **Social Media & Notifications:** LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter notifications.
		2. Uses **spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for detecting dates and monetary terms
		3. **Dependency parsing** detects action-related phrases in context.
		4. **Rule-based matching** improves detection of urgency and deadlines.
		5. make as much use of nlp as it can improve performances
		6. user the gpt_priority score as a feature too
4. Train classifier model 
	1. (e.g., **RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, or LightGBM**).
	2. For the best classifier model implementation, we need: ✅ A structured dataset based on analysis_results (features from emails). ✅ Feature selection & preprocessing to optimize performance. ✅ A strong ML model: We'll compare Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. ✅ Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna for the best performance. ✅ Evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy, precision, and recall. 📌 Steps for Our Model Prepare Data: Convert analysis_results dictionaries into a structured pandas DataFrame. Feature Engineering: Encode categorical features, normalize numerical values. Train-Test Split: Use train_test_split to avoid overfitting. Model Selection: Use RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, then select the best. Hyperparameter Optimization: Use Optuna for tuning. Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure performance. 📌 Install Dependencies pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm optuna 📌 Why This is the Best Approach? ✅ Handles Boolean & Numeric Features Efficiently Converts boolean values to integers (0/1). Works well with tree-based models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and RandomForest. ✅ Uses Hyperparameter Optimization (Optuna) Automatically finds the best model (RandomForest, XGBoost, or LightGBM). Tunes hyperparameters for best accuracy. ✅ Performs Well on Small and Large Datasets RandomForest is great for smaller datasets. XGBoost & LightGBM are faster & better for large data. ✅ Provides Evaluation Metrics Accuracy Score: Measures overall correctness. Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, F1-score. ROC-AUC Score: Evaluates model quality for priority classification.
	3. save the model using joblib
	4. ✅ **Continuous Model Improvement** – Store predictions and update the model periodically.
5. Post Processing
	1. structure mails data for display, sorting etc afterwards
	2. sort mails by priorities
6. Output:
	1. UI interface to display this nicely
		1. Allow user to click a mail element and redirect him to the mail in outlook
	2. use GPT to make a globla summary and suggest how to takle this


can you give me a good way to structure my app architecture (folder structure scripts names and what it does and which step(s) of the pipeline it corresponds to) and tell me for each step of the pipeline what script is used, show them back to back with input --> script --> output etc...

give me the code to do step 3 (summarize mails in batches and get priority), given that all the necessary mails data is assumed to already be located in data/processed/`

before doing that tell me what the best batch size is knowing:
- that I want to minimize costs without compromising accuracy
- we can have to process thousands of emails
- I'll use gpt-4o-mini (better than 3.5 and much cheaper than 4o but it is probably not in your knowledge base dw about that)
  
here are the steps of step 3:
### **Step 3: Summarization & Priority Scoring (OpenAI API)**

- **Goal:** Summarize emails & assign priority scores using GPT, cached to save costs.
- **Script:** `scripts/summarize_priority.py`
- **Input:**
    - Anonymized emails from `data/processed/`
- **Processing:**
    - Vectorize emails (sentence transformers)
    - Check cache: If email already summarized, reuse
    - Query OpenAI API in efficient batches
    - Store priority scores & de-anonymized summaries
- **Output:**
    - JSON with `"priority_score"` + summary added in `data/processed/`
