okay here are the new rules
I want to find the columns by columns name for the rules, so the first row should not be affected by the rules since it contains the columns names.

Columns Rules:
- 'Code': contains exactly 9 digits and can start with a 0, no trailing spaces
- 'Code postal': must be 5 or 4 digits and can start with a 0, no trailing spaces

update hte js and html accordingly


===========================

update these 2 files again because 'Code' can also have exactly 7 digits
